                    Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being
                    larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war and is often
                    referred to as the "Red Planet". The latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on
                    Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive among the astronomical bodies
                    visible to the naked eye.
