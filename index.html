            <h1>Humans live on Mars <br>is it possible?</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Living on Mars is theoretically possible but involves overcoming significant challenges such as its thin, mostly carbon
            dioxide atmosphere, extreme temperatures, high radiation levels, and low gravity. Essential solutions include developing
            reliable life support systems, creating sustainable habitats using Martian resources, and ensuring a degree of
            self-sufficiency for food and water. While current technology and research, along with international collaboration, are
            paving the way, human colonization of Mars remains a goal that could potentially be realized within the next few
            decades.</p>

                    <h4>USA started the exploration of Mars</h4>
                    <p>The United States, through NASA, initiated Mars exploration with the Mariner 4 mission, which launched in 1964 and
                    performed the first successful flyby of Mars in 1965.</p>

                    <h4>Soviet Union/Russia</h4>
                    <p>The Soviet Union (now Russia) also made early attempts to explore Mars with its Mars program, starting with Mars 1 in
                    1962, although their early missions faced various challenges and failures.</p>

                    <p>Europe's ExoMars programme has always had the ambition to marry exploration with science. ESA's vision is to send
                    Europeans to Mars by 2040. .</p>

                    <p>China has more recently entered Mars exploration, with its Tianwen-1 mission, which successfully placed an orbiter
                    around Mars and landed the Zhurong rover on the Martian surface in 2021.</p>

                    <h4>India (ISRO)</h4>
                    <p>ISRO uses a method of travel called a Hohmann Transfer Orbit – or a Minimum Energy Transfer Orbit – to send a spacecraft
                    from Earth to Mars with the least amount of fuel possible.</p>

                    second country to successfully enter Mars' orbit on its first try after India. </p>
